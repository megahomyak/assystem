ASSystem is A Storage System that's total ASS. It's a simple key-value storage, as simple as I could make it, stored in a single file. No running daemons, complex APIs or outer dependencies, just plain and simple (and rather dumb) `get`, `insert`, `remove` and `list`.

=== LIMITATIONS ===

This allocator, unfortunately, assumes two things:
* The database size will never be bigger than 2**64 bytes (which is around 16384 pebibytes) - if it will be, this thing will go into Undefined Behavior
* There will always be enough storage for extending the database - if there won't be, this thing will just crash
Both issues should be easily fixable, so it's not a design flaw. The author doesn't want to fix these issues right now because they don't bother him

There's also a possibility of database file corruption if any of the modifying database operations gets interrupted. IDK how to work around this one yet
