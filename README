ASSystem is A Storage System that's total ASS. It's a simple key-value storage, as simple as I could make it, stored in a single file. No running daemons, complex APIs or outer dependencies, just plain and simple (and rather dumb) `get`, `insert`, `remove` and `list`.

=== LIMITATIONS ===

This allocator, unfortunately, assumes these things:
* The database size will never be bigger than 2**64 bytes (which is around 16384 pebibytes) - if it will be, this thing will go into Undefined Behavior
* There will always be enough storage for extending the database - if there won't be, this thing will just crash
* There will be no issue with reading or writing - if there will be, this thing will just crash (and will likely leave you with a corrupted database)
All of these issues should be easily fixable, so it's not a design flaw. The author doesn't want to fix these issues right now because they don't bother him

There's also a possibility of database file corruption if any of the modifying database operations gets interrupted (for example, on a power down or on a sudden disk unavailability). IDK how to work around this one yet

This software is very down-to-earth in general and barely makes any accomodations for unusual situations, so please, use it as a hammer, not as a bulldozer. If you want, you can read the source code and freely extend the software (and you also may ask the dev for help in understanding the software)
